        <h1>Shelter</h1>
        <p>AT SHELTER, WE’VE THOROUGHLY REINVENTED NEW-HOME CONSTRUCTION, SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING EVERYTHING FROM THE BASIC STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS TO THE WAY THEY ARE FABRICATED, DELIVERED, AND ASSEMBLED ON SITE. THE RESULT IS A HOUSE THAT DELIVERS HIGHEST LEVELS OF ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENT, ENERGY PERFORMANCE, COMFORT, DURABILITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY—WITH A PROCESS THAT’S FASTER, EASIER, AND MORE REWARDING FOR YOU.</p>

        <div id="one">
          <h2>FULLY DIGITIZED COMPUTER MODELING</h2>
          <p>Every Shelter starts in the OPAL studio, with a fully detailed 3D computer model adjusted to reflect the unique features of your site. We then export the computer file directly to the production line, where it guides the manufacture of the building shell components, radically simplifying construction and achieving a higher degree of control and accuracy than is possible in site-built projects.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="two">
          <h2>PREFABRICATED FOUNDATION SYSTEM</h2>
          <p>Shelter utilizes prefabricated foundation systems to accommodate a variety of site conditions. Our precast foundation panels are installed quickly, limiting the need for an on-site concrete mixer. Your general contractor oversees excavation and the installation of a compacted-stone base. Shelter coordinates delivery of the foundation components, cranes them into place, and assembles them into a complete foundation.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="three">
          <h2>PANELIZED CLT BUILDING SHELL</h2>
          <p>Shelter’s innovative all-wood building shell begins with our proprietary composite floor, wall, and roof panels, which consist of a cross laminated timber (CLT) core, a layer of rigid wood fiber insulation, OSB exterior sheathing, and a continuous air barrier. In our climate-controlled facility, we use your Shelter’s computer design model to 3D print the panels that will make up the building envelope.</p>
          <p>When assembled, the finished panels create an air-sealed building shell, with continuous exterior insulation that virtually eliminates thermal bridging from indoors to outdoors and dramatically reduces heat loss.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="four">
          <h2>WALL BUILDUP</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>3-1/2’’ CLT</li>
            <li>6-10’’ wood fiber insulation</li>
            <li>OSB Sheathing</li>
            <li>R30-45 thermal performance (depending on climate)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="five">
          <h2>MODULAR, DROP-IN KITCHEN AND BATHROOM PODS</h2>
          <p>Kitchens and baths are the most design- and construction-intensive rooms in any house. To control finish quality and speed on-site construction, we build complete, fully plumbed Shelter kitchens and bathroom pods in our production facility and deliver them as drop-in modules, ready to be craned into place and connected to the house’s utility systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="six">
          <h2>PANELIZED CLT ROOF SYSTEM</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>7-1/4’’CLT Panel</li>
            <li>10’’ wood fiber insulation</li>
            <li>OSB sheathing</li>
            <li>R45 thermal performance (depending on climate)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="seven">
          <h2>DURABLE, LOW-MAINTENANCE EXTERIOR</h2>
          <p>Your Shelter shrugs off the elements with exterior finish materials that combine durability, low maintenance, and authentic good looks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cedar siding</li>
            <li>Cedar trim</li>
            <li>Standing-seam metal roofing (covered by a 40-year warranty, provides easy mounting for rooftop solar panels)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="eight">
          <h2>CLEAN, BRIGHT INTERIOR</h2>
          <p>Shelter’s fully integrated palette of interior materials and finishes creates a calm, peaceful environment and an elegant backdrop for the way you choose to live.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CLT walls and ceilings</li>
            <li>Solid, painted doors</li>
            <li>Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities</li>

        <div id="nine">
          <h2>SAFE, HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT</h2>
